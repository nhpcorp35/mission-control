# Mission Control API

Minimal cloud HTTP wrapper around the Mission Control validator and read-only executor.

## Base URL

The service listens on the host and port configured at deploy time. On Railway, the public URL is assigned by the platform.

## Endpoints

### GET /health

Liveness check.

**Response** `200 OK`

```json
{
  "status": "ok"
}
```

### POST /validate

Validate mission YAML against Mission Specification v1.0. This performs structural validation only; it does not check run eligibility or execute a mission.

**Request body** `application/json`

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mission_yaml` | string | yes | Full mission document as YAML text |

**Example request**

```json
{
  "mission_yaml": "version: 1.0\nmission_id: example\n..."
}
```

**Response** `200 OK`

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ok` | boolean | `true` when the mission is structurally valid |
| `error` | string or null | Validation error message when `ok` is `false` |

**Example success**

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "error": null
}
```

**Example failure**

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": "Missing required keys: permissions"
}
```

### POST /run

Validate a mission, confirm it is eligible for Phase 2 read-only execution, then invoke the existing Cursor Agent executor.

Validation order:

1. Structural validation (`load_mission_yaml`)
2. Run-eligibility validation (`validate_mission_for_run`)
3. Read-only execution (`run_cursor_agent`)

**Request body** `application/json`

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mission_yaml` | string | yes | Full mission document as YAML text |

**Response** `200 OK`

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ok` | boolean | `true` when execution completed successfully |
| `stdout` | string | Agent stdout on success or partial failure |
| `stderr` | string | Agent stderr when available |
| `error` | string or null | Error message when `ok` is `false` |

**Example success**

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "stdout": "agent response\n",
  "stderr": "",
  "error": null
}
```

**Example validation failure**

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "stdout": "",
  "stderr": "",
  "error": "Unsupported version: 2.0 (expected 1.0)"
}
```

**Example execution failure**

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "stdout": "",
  "stderr": "agent failed",
  "error": "agent failed",
  "error_detail": null
}
```

**Example Cursor CLI preflight failure**

Returned before execution when `cursor-agent` is unavailable or `CURSOR_API_KEY` is not configured.

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "stdout": "",
  "stderr": "",
  "error": "CURSOR_API_KEY environment variable is not set. Create a key at https://cursor.com/dashboard/api and configure it as a Railway service variable.",
  "error_detail": {
    "code": "CURSOR_API_KEY_MISSING",
    "message": "CURSOR_API_KEY environment variable is not set. Create a key at https://cursor.com/dashboard/api and configure it as a Railway service variable.",
    "stage": "preflight"
  }
}
```

Preflight error codes:

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `CURSOR_AGENT_UNAVAILABLE` | `cursor-agent` is not installed or not on `PATH` |
| `CURSOR_API_KEY_MISSING` | `CURSOR_API_KEY` is unset or empty |

## Safety

The API exposes only mission validation and read-only execution. It does not provide shell access, arbitrary filesystem operations, Git commands, or other command endpoints.

## Local development

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the server:

```bash
uvicorn app.api:app --reload
```

Run tests:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

## Railway deployment

Mission Control is configured for Railway using Nixpacks. The build installs Cursor CLI with the official installer, and the start script ensures `~/.local/bin` is on `PATH` before Uvicorn starts.

### Required environment variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CURSOR_API_KEY` | yes | Cursor user API key from [cursor.com/dashboard/api](https://cursor.com/dashboard/api). Used by `cursor-agent` at runtime. Do not commit this value. |
| `PORT` | yes | Provided automatically by Railway. |

Set `CURSOR_API_KEY` in the Railway service **Variables** tab. Use a secret/reference variable, not a hardcoded value in the repo.

### Build and start commands

Railway reads:

- `nixpacks.toml` — installs `curl`, then runs `scripts/install-cursor-agent.sh`
- `railway.json` — starts the API with `scripts/railway-start.sh`

The install script runs:

```bash
curl -fsS https://cursor.com/install | bash
```

The start script exports `PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"` and launches Uvicorn.

### Startup logging

On boot, the API logs a Cursor CLI startup check:

```text
Cursor CLI startup check: installed=<true|false> authenticated=<true|false> binary=<path|not found>
```

`authenticated` means `CURSOR_API_KEY` is configured. It does not call Cursor's servers during startup.

### Smoke test on Railway

Use the Railway reference mission, which points at the deployed repo root:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST "$RAILWAY_PUBLIC_URL/run" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data-binary @- <<EOF
{
  "mission_yaml": "$(sed 's/"/\\"/g' missions/reference/valid-v1.0-railway.yaml | tr '\n' '\\n')"
}
EOF
```

Or POST the contents of `missions/reference/valid-v1.0-railway.yaml` from your local machine against the deployed `/run` endpoint.

### Local development with Cursor CLI

Install Cursor CLI locally:

```bash
curl -fsS https://cursor.com/install | bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
export CURSOR_API_KEY="crsr_..."
```

Then run Uvicorn as usual. The API augments `PATH` at startup so `cursor-agent` resolves from `~/.local/bin` when the official installer was used.
